Given an array of intergers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is a product of all the numbers i  the original array except the one at i.

For example if our input is
```

arrayOfInt = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
expectedOutput = [120, 60, 40, 30, 24];

arrayOfInt = [3, 2, 1];
expectedOutput = [2, 3, 6];

```

Follw up: What if you can't use division
